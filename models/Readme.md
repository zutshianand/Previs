# Models and Implementation

We provide different implementations of training different models in this subdirectory here.
Machine learnign and deep learning uses both traditional and modern models.

Traditional models include models like SVM, Random forest etc. These models, although
easy to implement in code, takes up some time for the user to search online and implement.
Also, there are certain issues when implementing these models. These include deciding
which one to implement in case of regression and also classification.

We try to solve these problmes by providing a well accessible codebase for almost all the
traditional and modern models.

In case of regression as well as classification.

## Regression

We provide the following for regresison use cases:
* Catboost 
* Linear regression
* Ridge regression
* Lasso regression
* Elastic net regression
* XGBoost regression

We also provide how to use the state of the art model **AutoGluon** in Python.
