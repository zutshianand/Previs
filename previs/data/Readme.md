The different data resources are listed here. While forking this repository, you can also
add more data resources here and use them while modifiying this repository as per
your requirements.

The current data resources in this repository are as follows:

## Chatwords
This consitutes of the different chat abbreviations which we normally use 
while conversing in chat with someone. This is presented in a list format.
You can add more in the list and the existing list is in no manner whatsoever 
comprehensive in nature.

## Emoticons
This contains a comprehensive list of emoticons and emojis which are present
in unicode fashion and are used in text preprocessing. Although you can add your own
as well and make the list more comprehensive, we strongly encourage you to go through
the existing list and ensure that your needs are not completely fulfilled.

## Mapping dict
This is dictionary of usually incorrect words in sentences. You can add more if you
want. As of now, it contains the following:
* contraction mappings
* mispelled words
* special punctuation mappings
* spaces
* rare word mappings
* bad case words

These are present in ```json``` format and you can add more if you want. However,
we do encourage you to go through the list beforehand to ensure that you are not duplicating
and increasing your effort unecessary.

## Bad words
This contains the list of bad words. This can be used when there are reviews which
are used for text based tasks. The count of bad words used can be a good indicator
of the review and something like this can be used extensively.
